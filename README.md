# Tesla Stock Case Study: From Tweets to Trends (2020–2025)

An exploratory data analysis of Tesla’s stock performance from January–April across six years, examining price trends, volatility, and leadership influence — with a spotlight on the 2025 DOGE Era.


## Project Summary
This analysis focuses on Tesla’s early-year stock behavior (Jan–Apr, 2020–2025), emphasizing:
- Year-over-year closing price trends
- Volatility patterns across leadership eras
- The impact of Elon Musk's DOGE appointment in 2025

The dashboard and supporting visuals were built in Power BI, with preprocessing and era labeling completed in Python.
